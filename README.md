  Anyone cloning this repo will need to configure their *context.xml* file.
  Because everyones machines are different they will need to configure
  their port number to their own port, in order to connect to the database.

### CONFIGURE

  Sample of what the context file should include where 3306 
  is your port number;

  ```xml 
  <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
      <Context path="/Lab7">
           <Resource
            name="jdbc/userdb"
            url="jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/userdb"  
            username="root"
            password="password"
            maxActive="100"
            maxIdle="30"
            maxWait="10000" 
            logAbandoned="true"
            removeAbandoned="true" 
            removeAbandonedTimeout="60"
            driverClassName="com.mysql.jdbc.Driver"
            type="javax.sql.DataSource"
            auth="Container"/>
      </Context>
